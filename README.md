# Security Testing with OWASP ZAP

This repository contains a Python script that leverages the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) to perform automated security testing on a specified target web application. The script performs a variety of tests, including spidering, passive scanning, active scanning, fuzzing, SQL injection checks, and XSS checks.

## Features

- **Spidering**: Crawls the target application to discover all its pages and endpoints.
- **Passive Scanning**: Analyzes the traffic passively to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Active Scanning**: Actively probes the application to identify security weaknesses.
- **Fuzzing**: Sends various payloads to endpoints to find potential security flaws.
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Checks if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing**: Checks for XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Report Generation**: Generates an HTML report of the findings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OWASP ZAP
- `requests` library
- `python-owasp-zap-v2.4` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-testing-zap.git
   cd security-testing-zap
   
**Install the required Python libraries:**
bash
pip install requests python-owasp-zap-v2.4
**Download and set up OWASP ZAP:**
Download OWASP ZAP from the official website. Install and start OWASP ZAP on your local machine.

Configuration
Set up the configuration in the script:
**Ensure ZAP is running and listening on the specified URL and port (default: http://localhost:8080).

**The script will execute the following steps:**

Access the target URL
Spider the target application
Perform passive scanning
Conduct active scanning
Fuzz endpoints with various payloads
Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
Check for XSS vulnerabilities
Generate an HTML report of the findings
View the generated report:

After the tests are completed, open zap_report.html to review the findings and vulnerabilities discovered during the tests.
